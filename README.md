## 🙋‍♂️ A bit about me

[![My GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=eriktaveras)](https://github.com/eriktaveras/github-readme-stats)

Hey! I'm a jack-of-all-trades developer who blends creativity with technical solutions. I started my journey behind a camera, and now I lead digital operations at PRB where I'm all about automating processes, improving workflows, and building internal web apps that make everything smoother and faster.

I love creating custom solutions with Python and Django, building Shopify integrations that *actually* save time, and optimizing systems for teams handling thousands of images. Whether I'm deploying MVPs, enhancing e-commerce filtering systems, or managing secure infrastructure, my goal is to simplify the complex and deliver results that make an impact.
